Hello everyone, good afternoon, I'm Wayne.
I hope you all have a wonderful holiday. I do. I went back to my hometown and I did have a lot of fun.
Until at the end of the vocation I decide to drive back to Shanghai with my family. The whole trip was expected to be less than 8 hours but I ended up spending 18 hours of our life on the road. Just too much traffic.

I believe some of you shares the same experience with me. In a long trip, it's very frustrating to keep asking and answering "are we there yet?", or "how many hours left?".

So it's quite important to keep everyone entertained and maintain your sanity until you reach your destination. To me, car games is the perfect way to have fun here. 

The benefits of car games is that they are quite flexible. First you can involve everyone in the game, even the driver. Second is that you don't have to pack poker and clean up a space to play poker, you don't keep you iPhone/iPad alive through the whole trip.


I will be introducing five popular games. For each game I will introduce it's rule and I will make a few example if the rule is not that clear. I have played all of them on the way to Shanghai last week.

1.  Zitch dog. Z-I-T-C-H-DOG, This one comes from the TV show How I met your mother, which is one of my favorite show by the way. Anyway, the rule is quite simple, every time you see a dog you gotta to say ZITCHDOG. The first one who did that will get one point. At the end of the trip, the one with the most points win. This is the perfect game you should play along with other games. It's kind of exciting to hear a "ZITCH DOG" while everyone are sleepy, they will be like "where is the dog, where is the dog... " 

2.  I spy. To play this game, one person in the car will choose an object around everyone. He or she then gives the other people a clue by stating the color of the object, or give the first letter of the name of the object, or any another clue. The object should inside the car or that will be in everyone's line of vision for at least a few minutes. The person who guesses the object correctly is the next person to spy a new item. 

3.  Alphabet. This is a classic one. It can be played as a solo game if you are driving alone or played as a team game if you got other player in the car. The goal is to look for every letter of the alphabet, in alphabetical order. You can either utilize all the reading material outside of the window, or limit it to just license plates. One fun fact for this that there is no O and I in the license plates in China. You can use 0 and 1 for replacement.

4.  The next one is Team Storytelling. This is a classic too. Everyone in the car will compose a group story. One person in the car starts by creating the first line of the story, you can start with the classic "one upon a time there lives a princess", or something not so common, such as "There is a desk flying on the sky". Next, each person in the car adds a line to keep the story continues. It could get quite interesting and silly after a few rounds. The desk might be actually be a dragon.

5.  The last one is Fortunately-Unfortunately. This one is my favorite. It's quite handy if someone in the car is going crazy. In this game, one person will make a unfortunate statement and then another player should counter this statement to a fortunate one. For example, one could start with "you fell into the river" and the other one could counter this by "fortunately I can swim". I have tried some much more silly cases but I don't think it's the right place to say it today. Just to be creative and it will be extraordinary fun.


So these are the five games I played on my last trip. Everyone was having a good time. They are still tired for sure, after all it's a 18 hours trip. But everyone did have a good time playing these games.

I would suggest all of you try these games or build up your own games if you are going to take a long road trip with a group of people.  It will get everyone involved, and every player will be more connected to each other at the end of the trip.

Thank you. That's all.
