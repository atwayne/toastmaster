## Hi, I'm Wayne

Hi, I'm Wayne. I'm a developer from Unit VIII.

This is my p1 speech, and I will give us a self introduction.

I will go with my Chinese name first.

Someone may have already know my Chinese name, which I will talk about it later.
What they don't know is I got a different name during my childhood.
It's 'WW', I'm going to write it down.

One of the elders in the village gave this name.
Most of you already know the first character is my family name so I will skip it and go with the other one.
It's means something beautify and some thing rare. I liked that name
