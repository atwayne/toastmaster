## Hi, I'm Wayne

Hi, I'm Wayne. I'm a developer from GSM, I came from Unit VIII, same as Weijie.
I will introduce my self to everyone as my icebreak speeck today.

I will start with my name.

Just in cas any of you missed it, my name is Wayne, and I will put it down on this board.

I choose this name from Bruce Wayne. Does anyone in this room know who Bruce Wayne is?

Correct. Thank you, yes, it's the name of batman. Bruce Wayne.
He is one of my favorite superheros. Actually you know what? I take it back, he is offically my favorite superhere.
Here is why:

first, he is rich, super rich. Everyone wants to be rich. And to be honest, if you got a chance to become a superhero, you must choose batman over, let's say, spiderman. right?
at least you don't have to live a undercover life as a newspaper reporter, right? That's not cool for a super hero.

second reason he is my favorite is that batman is actually one of the a few superheros who doesn't have any super power. Although someone would argue that him having a lot of money is kind of superpower.
Let's not argue with that.. Not only batman himself, most of his enimies doesn't have any super power as well. They are just human beings, they fight in fresh, in great mind, in intelegence.
That's kind of cool to me.

The last reason is that batman is a badass. He raises from the dark, his father dies in front of him, his mother dies in front of him, his parter, and even his parter dies in front of him. That's horrible for a human being.
That's a lot to take even for the batman. He had every reason to turn in to Darth Vadar, to destory the city or at least let others destory the city.
But he didn't. One of my favorite sence from the movie is that in the Dark knight raise, the cat woman said to the batman, "come with me, you don't owe this city anything, you have done enough for this city"
and batman just said, "not everything, not yet."
this is the moment I fell in love with this character.


Ok, enough of batman, let's get back to my name Wayne. Another reason I choose Wayne as my English name is it rythms with my chinese name. WW.
Yes it's the same name of one of the greatest poems in anicent China.
But to tell you guys a secret, I once have a different name in my childhood. It is WW.
The first character is my family name, I believe at least 20% of you guys in this room shares the same family name with me so I will skip it today.
The second character means some kind of diamonds, it also means some thing unoridinary, something rare. Funny story is althouth it seems like a simple character, a lot of my teachers and classmates in my primary school don't know how to pronunce it correctly.
They always call me WW, to avoid any misunderstoodion, before my entrance examation of my middle school, I went to the local police office to have my name chagned to WW.
That's how I got this name now.


Seems like time is up, I will go through my hobbies quickly in a minute.

As you can tell, I loves science fictions, movies, books, comics. I once co-founded a science fiction assication in my colledge, we have a lot of famous writers in china as our guest speaker.
I also loves badminton, I actually won two titles during my colledge life.
I also loves billards, aka, the pool, I met my wife during an activity. But that's another story I am going to tell you guys.


That's all, thank you everyone.
