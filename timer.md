Good afternoon everyone, my name is Wayne. I'm your timer today.

As a Timer, my role is to remind speakers on how much time they have spent on their speech, and how much time they have left before they should finish their speech.

The length of the table topics is 1-2 minutes, that's to say, you should speak for at least one minute and 2 minutes at most.
For prepared speech, it's 4-6 minutes, and the speaker is allowed to talk for 30 more seconds after time is up. Please note that these extra seconds are just for prepared speech, and speakers, please try your best to not use these extra seconds.

For other roles, such as guest speech and evaluation, the length of your speech is already mentioned in the agenda.

As you can see, I have a few cards with different colors.

I will raise the Green card when the speech is long enough, I will raise the Red card when the suggested time is finished.

For prepared speech and for prepared speech only, we have two more cards, the yellow card and the black card.
The yellow card will raise when the speaker have only one minute left, please consider it as a warning.
The black card will raise when you have spend the extra 30 seconds. The speaker are expected to stop their speech at the moment they see the black card.

So basically,  green card means the speech is long enough, yellow card means warning, red card means time is up, black card means stop right now.

At the end of the meeting, I will present my report for everyone.

For now, please enjoy the meeting! Back to you toastmaster.
