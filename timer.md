Good afternoon everyone, my name is XX. I'm your timer today.

As a Timer, my role is to sit there, keep record of time, and remind speakers on how much time they spent on their speech, and how much time they have  left before they should finish their speech.

I will raise the Green card when the speech is long enough according to their projects, usually 1 min for table topics and 4 mins for prepared speech.
I will raise the Red card when the suggested time is finished, usually 2 mins for table topics and 6 mins for prepared speech.

For prepared speech and for prepared speech only, we have two more cards, yellow card and black card.
The yellow card will raise when the speaker have one minute left, please consider it as a warning.
We will allow you to speak for 30 more seconds after the the red card. And then I will raise the black card, you are expected to stop your speech right now as you see the black card.

For other roles, such as guest speech and evaluation, the speakers should only pay attention to green card and red card. The length of your speech is already mentioned in the agenda.

So basically,  green card means the speech is long enough, yellow card means warning, red card means time is up, black card means stop right now.

At the end of the meeting, I will present my report for everyone.

For now, please enjoy the meeting! Back to you XX.
