
I spend my first year in college watching TV shows and movies. I’m not proud of this but it was a truly meaningful year to me. I have watched tons of movies that year, among all these movies I watched, Star wars is my favorite. I cannot even remember how many times I watched it, at least ten I think.


Today I am going to share why I love it, why you should watch it, and watch it again if you have done that already. And I promise you I would not spoiler anything.


First, to those who haven’t watched it, Star Wars is one of the most iconic movie series of all time. Watching one should satisfy your sense of curiosity. It would also help you understand all the Star Wars reference you didn’t get in other TV shows. For example, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, How I Met your Mother or basically any drama shows, there are a lot of iconic dialogs quotes in these shows. Also, people in these shows choose to cosplay as Star Wars characters during Halloween, for example, Han Solo, C3PO, Chewbacca, Darth Vader and of course Princess Leia. Actually this is the reason for me to watch Star Wars for the first time.


Second, to those who hate complicated storyline such as parallel universe, time traveling, Star Wars is not that hard to follow. Just because it attracts a lot of geeks, it doesn’t mean the stories are complicated like some other science fiction movies. It’s the perfect choice if you are about to watch your first science fiction movie.


Third, it’s a movie for all ages and multi-genre. Kids would love the fantasy and adventure elements, teenagers would go for the coming-of-age themes, young adults would like the action and sci-fi and everyone else would love the epic storytelling with amazing music and soundtracks.


Ok, so far we got these reasons, a, it’s one of the most iconic movie series of all time; b, the storyline is easy to follow; c, it’s for all ages. It sounds like you have very little to lose by giving Star Wars a chance if you haven’t watch them yet.


Personally speaking, I love Star Wars not only because of these reasons. To me the Star Wars series is a showcase of some of the greatest technologies in science fiction. You got light sabers, AT-AT walkers, x-Wings, the Death Star, the Star Destroyers and especially the Millennium Falcons. I know by saying these names of weapons and spaceships, I must have either made you excited or sleeping already. But trust me, you got to see these once in your life. This is actually the reason why Hollywood started to believe in special effects and fiction for blockbusters.


Another reason I love this so much is that George Lucas did a great job on world building. They are not kidding when they say Star Wars is a universe. They have all these wonderful characters, good or evil. They have all these cute creatures; many of them even have their own languages.


In short, because the Star Wars movies are both incredibly popular and well received for many technology accomplishments, and there’s very little at stake, they are free on Tencent video, it seems like it would be worth your time to give them a try, again, and again.
